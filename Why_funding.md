# WHY FUNDING? #
I am an engineering student working part‑time on weekends while running out of government funding.
Supporting this project directly helps me continue building, maintaining, and improving my own work.
Many student projects die after graduation because there is no time or funding to maintain them.
Your support helps keep this project alive and actively developed.
